		<h1>Solution</h1>
		<h2></h2>Our Item Choices</h2>
        		<ol>
            		<li>Magnetic Compass - This would be used to help us navigate and keep us from wandering deeper into the desert. We are most likely to find cities and towns near the ocean, so we would head to the west.</li>
            		<li>15 Gallons of Water - While water is absolutely vital for human life, the weight of fifteen gallons of water has lowered it to of second most importance. The containers would also prove useful if we were to come across a body of freshwater on our way to the nearest city.</li>
           			<li>First Aid Kit - Any type of first aid is essential when wandering through an unfamiliar area. While it wouldn’t help with any major injuries like bone fractures or large wounds, it would help with smaller wounds in places that are likely to develop an infection.</li>
        			<li>Snake Bite Kit - This kit would also be good for a “just in case” scenario. It would not be ideal to have a group member die from a snake bite in the middle of a desert when we have other things to worry about.</li>
					<li>Pocket Knife - In the absence of other utility tools, a pocket knife would be very useful for a variety of tasks. It's hard to predict exactly what situations one would come across when wandering aimlessly through the Sahara, but one (1) pocket knife would possibly do more good than not.</li>
        		</ol>
		<h2>Our Strategy</h2>
			<p>For our team's strategy, we have decided to make our way to the coast since that is most likely where we will find a city or town for further help. The compass will lessen our chances of wandering further into the desert especially at noon or during the night when it would be more difficult to figure out which way is west. We have also figured that splitting up the weight of the water more or less evenly between us and the two crew members would be best since fifteen gallons of water weigh about 125 pounds. While we wouldn't be solely looking for water, it would be a good thing to keep an eye out for. Waiting until nightfall to start travelling is probably the most important part of this plan since that would help protect us from the heat. With all of these decisions together, we hope that we would be able to find other people who could help us get out of the desert and back home.</p>
